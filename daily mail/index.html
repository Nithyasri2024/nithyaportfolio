      <p class="head">Primary school teacher, 39, chokes back tears and slams the RSPCA as she is CLEARED of animal cruelty over footage of her punching and kicking horse Bruce Almighty that led to her losing job and receiving hand delivered death threats</p>
      <img src="images/one.png " alt=" " class="img-responsive">
      <p>Sarah Moulds was found not guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal, a grey pony she owned called Bruce Almighty, after footage surfaced of her punching and kicking the horse on November 6 2021. Video was shared by the Hertfordshire Hunt Saboteurs campaign group, which claimed it was evidence of 'violence running through [the] veins' of groups hunting animals for sport. But a jury of 11 men and one woman cleared Moulds, 39, of animal cruelty after just over five hours of deliberation following a three day trial at Lincoln Crown Court. Outside court, the ex-teacher hit out at the RSPCA for failing to engage with her, claiming that their case would have fallen apart had they visited Bruce to inspect him after the incident itself.</p>

Today it emerged the 45-year-old father-of-three had been the victim of a previous break-in just months earlier, which saw thieves ransacking his humble end-of-terrace house in Radcliffe, Manchester. The details were revealed in a heartbreaking note by Mr Patience to his neighbours in January.</p>

            <p>It was here that Richard Burton proposed to Elizabeth Taylor, and where Sophia Loren, Ernest Hemingway and Frank Sinatra came to escape the crowds. Today, Rolex, Louis Vuitton and Dolce & Gabbana shopfronts line the narrow cobbled lanes, alongside expensive restaurants, pretty cafes and high-end bars where a cognac can cost up to £350. At breakfast time, impeccably dressed visitors idle along the main street, eyeing up designer handbags, while wealthy locals exchange pleasantries in the famed Piazza Martiri dell'Olivetta. This tiny paradise is Italy at its best. But, as the Mail discovered on a visit this week, the morning's tranquillity is fleeting.</p>

            <img src="images/aaa.png" alt="" class="img-responsive">
            <p>EXCLUSIVE: Shopkeepers across Britain are suffering from an outbreak of thefts amid the cost-of-living crisis as shoplifting incidents rise by more than a quarter in a year. Small gangs are 'hitting' stores in what the British Independent Retailers Association has described as 'stealing to order' and compared to the county lines drugs issue. Reported retail thefts have now risen by 27 per cent across ten of the UK's largest cities - and were up by 68 per cent in some, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said. This week, MailOnline visited popular areas for independent shops in London, Birmingham and the North East and learned how businesses are being targeted. One trader lost £100,000 worth of jewellery and cash during a distraction theft - while a separate incident saw a woman flash her breasts at him after stealing items. JD Sports has been at the eye of the shoplifting storm this month after widely-shared posts on TikTok and Snapchat two weeks ago invited yobs to wear balaclavas and gloves and 'rob JD Sports' on Oxford Street at 3pm on a Wednesday afternoon. Other chains such as John Lewis, Waitrose Tesco, Sainsbury's and Boots are now issuing staff bodycams and training to deter violence from aggressive thieves.

       <p>EXCLUSIVE: Drivers trying to avoid the £12.50-a-day charge within London's Ultra Low Emission Zone (Ulez) can benefit from a new map plotting where the cameras are located. Transport for London uses hundreds of fixed cameras located across Central and Greater London to monitor which cars enter and exit the zone that runs 24/7. </p>

        <p class="head">Teacher caught on film punching and kicking her horse already has a new job as she tries to get her life 'back on track' after being found not guilty of animal cruelty - but reveals she has been flooded with abuse since the verdict</p>
        <img src="images/aaz.png" alt="" class="img-responsive">
        <p>EXCLUSIVE: Sarah Moulds, 39, added she is 'back teaching at another school' having been sacked over the incident and is 'very relieved' to have been found not guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to her protected grey pony, Bruce Almighty. 
             The mother-of-two also said the parents at the school she used to work at in her rural village of Somerby, Leicestershire, have
              been 'supportive'. Footage of her slapping and kicking a horse went viral in November 2021, and education chiefs swiftly carried
               out an investigation. The video was shared by the Hertfordshire Hunt Saboteurs campaign group, which claimed it was evidence of 
               'violence running through the veins' of those hunting animals for sport.</p>

But one of his rivals lashed out at the decision, calling Archie's attempts bog standard when they had spent hours of blood, sweat and tears on far more extravagant garden creations. Alex Dodman (right) claimed there were more worthy winners of the title after he spent £2,000 turning a disused gym in his garden into an impressive Alps-style ski chalet complete with outside swimming pool - and said Mr Proudfoot's is 'just a basic shed' that 'looks underwhelming from the outside.'</p>
